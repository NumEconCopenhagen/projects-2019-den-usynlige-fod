# README

This is the exam project for GQD575 and BRZ451. The portfolio consists of three projects: a data project, a model project and an exam project.


## Data project
In the data project we apply the Taylor rule to the US economy. We import data for the interest rate, the inflation, GDP and potential GDP using an API from the FED. We then make an interactive plot for the real interest rate and the Taylor rule for different parameters in the Taylor rule and for different time spans. We then estimate the parameters in the Taylor rule that make the best fit with the actual interest rate using three different ways to calculate the OLS estimator. Finally we perform some robustness checks to our analysis.

## Model project
In the model project we analyse a labor supply model with proportional taxation and progressive/regressive taxation. We analyse the optimal behavior of a worker analytically and graphically in a proportional tax system. After that we simulate a sample of agents with different preferences and income potentials. We analyse how different tax rates will affect these agents and estimate the tax rate which maximizes the tax revenue. We further plot an interactive Laffer curve in which it is possible to change the distribution of preferences and income potentials of the agents. After we have analysed these problems in a proportional tax system, we perform the same analyse in a progressive/regressive tax system.


## Exam project
The exam project consists of three different economics models with a total of fourteen different questions. First, we solve a labor supply model with human capital accumulation. We analyse this model graphically and using numerical optimization. Second, we solve a AS-AD model using analytical and graphical methods and by using numerical optimization. Finally, we solve a exchange economy model with three goods. We analyse this model graphically and by using a t√¢tonnement process numerical optimization.

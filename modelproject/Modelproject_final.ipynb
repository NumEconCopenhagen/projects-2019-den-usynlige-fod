    "Taxes play an important role for every individual in the economy. The size of the tax payment affects the disposible income, and thus the (possible) consumption level. The government collects taxes in order to finance its expenditures. The literatture has estimated that an increase in the marginal tax rate induces people to work less. This implies that the government cannot set a too high marginal tax rate in order to maximize its revenue. In the end, both workers and the government benefit from an optimal tax system. In this project, we examine the change of behaviour of a worker due to a change in the marginal tax rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we only consider changes on the intensive margin, i.e. how people adjust their work hours or/and effort due to changes in the marginal tax rate, and not if they change employment status due to a change in the marginal tax rate. Feldstein (1995) argues that taxable income as endogenous variable is better when estimating changes in behaviour due to changes in the marginal tax rate, since taxable income captures changes in hours worked and changes in work effort. We apply the same method as Feldstein (1995) and consider the change in taxable income from changes in the marginal tax rate. "

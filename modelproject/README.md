# Income taxation and behaviour of a worker.

In this project, we examine the change of behaviour of a worker due to a change in the marginal tax rate. We do this both analytically and grahpically. In the baseline model we consider a proportional tax system. We extend the baseline model and replicate the analysis with a progressive tax system.
